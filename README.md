# CS-B-EDAI3-HLT-MONT
A Health Monitoring Device which will detect and measure the SPo2 and BPM values and store it in the Blynk Application.
In this project I have also included the Arduino Libraries C header files for the MAX30100 Sensor as most of the times its not present in the Arduino IDE hence saving the effort of searching the raw files.
